Graphical user interface for data collection and plotting to be used at Rutgers' Laboratory of Artifical Quantum Matter.
Collects data from the Lock-In Amplifier which is synchronized with the Physical Property Measurement System machine using the MultiPyVu library. Used by physicists at LAQM to observe the unique non-linear transport properties of quantum matter under various temperature, magnetic, electrical, and pressure conditions.
