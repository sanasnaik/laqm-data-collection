Graphical user interface for data collection and plotting to be used at Rutgers' Laboratory of Artifical Quantum Matter.
Collects data from the Lock-In Amplifier which will be synchronized with the Physical Property Measurement System using 
the MultiPyVu library. Will assist researchers in observing the unique properties of quantum matter (their resistivities, etc.) under various temperature and pressure conditions.
