Graphical user interface for data collection and plotting to be used at Rutgers' Laboratory of Artifical Quantum Matter.
Collects data from the Lock-In Amplifier which is synchronized with the Physical Property Measurement System machine using the MultiPyVu library. Will assist researchers in observing the unique properties of quantum matter (their resistivities, etc.) under various temperature, magnetic, electrical, and pressure conditions.
